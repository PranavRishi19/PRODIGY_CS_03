## Overview

The Complexity Checker is a tool designed to analyze the complexity of code, algorithms, or processes. It provides insights into the efficiency and performance characteristics, helping developers to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize their code.

## Features

- **Code Complexity Analysis**: Analyze the complexity of functions, methods, and classes.
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Evaluate the time and space complexity of algorithms.
- **Performance Insights**: Gain insights into potential performance issues.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Receive suggestions for optimizing code to improve efficiency.

## How It Works

The Complexity Checker uses static code analysis techniques to evaluate the complexity of the provided code. It checks various metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, function length, and nesting levels to determine the overall complexity score.

### Example

Here is an example of how the Complexity Checker can be used to analyze a Python function:

```python
def example_function(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += i
        else:
            total -= i
    return total

# Usage
from complexity_checker import analyze_complexity

complexity_report = analyze_complexity(example_function)
print(complexity_report)
